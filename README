Deploy:

    Use deploy.sh to push files to the compilation folder of uPortal.
    Please double check paths in the deploy.sh script

Fetch-update: (To be done or replaced by git)

    If a new version is available, first use fetch-update.sh then use deploy.sh when
    you want to push the new updates to the compilation folder.

Deploy-Forced: (To be done)

    If changes are not efficient after compilation (happens sometimes...), you
    can use deploy-forced.sh with extra care to push changes to the running
    version of uPortal. This script will replace uPortal files directly in the
    production environment.


Please always have a look at path variables in the beginning of sh files to be
sure it fits the environment configuration.
